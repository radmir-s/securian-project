# Securian project

That was a team project about variable annuities, as well as some of the common derivatives instruments used to hedge the risks in the products to create proxy models to monitor risks and rebalance hedge positions intraday as the markets move in between model runs. My main contributions were testing different models of Linear Regression, adapting and testing Quadratic Interpolation models.
